Perl Modular Webserver written in Perl
====================================================================

This program was made solely to ease the simple tasks on a Sco box.

There are no warranties that this will work 100% and i can not be held
responsible for any loss by the use of this program.

There are three modules in the 'modules' folder, these are simply to output
data from the command line to the browser.
The duplicates module simply calls 'who -u' (a Sco/nix command) and looks
through all the users to see who is in there more than once.

The server has MIME support and can retrieve any HTML/Javscript/CSS
file from the public directory as a normal file and it will return the correct
Content-type to the browser.
More MIME types can be added to the lib/misc.pl file.

The project also has support for HTTP authentication, much like the .htaccess/.htpasswd
in Apache. This can be used anywhere in the project as follows: -

if( authorized('user', 'pass') == 1 ) {
	print 'Authorised';
}
else {
	push @{$request{DATA}{RESPONSE_HEADERS}}, { 'WWW-Authenticate' => 'Basic realm="Authentication Needed to use Clear Lock"' };
	$response{title} = "Clear Locks";
	$response{body} = 'Access Denied';
	$response{status} = "401";
	return %response;
}

Again, much more work could be put into this to make it better.

Lots more can be done with this project to improve it but it was a small project
so we didn't have to keep logging into ssh to do basic things on a busy server.

Folders
------------------
modules/
	You can place any module in here, they have function names that match the filename
data/
	Any private data, such as 'authed_users.txt'
lib/
	Library files
public/
	Everything in here is public to the browser to download

	
The server must be run by the following command: -

perl webserver.pl <portno>
